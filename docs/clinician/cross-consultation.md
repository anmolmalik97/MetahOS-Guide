> **Note:** The **XC** consultation will now be visible to both the original doctor and XC doctor.

## Accessing XC (from XC doctor).

The XC doctor can now see the XC consultation on his worklist as well, and by clicking on **XC**, the consultation will be set to **In-Progress**.

## Completing the XC (from XC doctor).

Once the XC doctor is done prescribing and consulting the patient, they can click the complete button in the consultation screen or from the worklist itself, to set the XC status to **Completed** and the original doctor and continue his consultation from here.

> **Note:** If the original consulting Doctor clicks on complete, then the entire consultation will be completed, not just the XC.

## Adding Multiple XC Doctors.

If the original consulting Doctor is not satisfied with the XC consultation, then he/she can repeat the above steps to add another XC Doctor on top of the previously consulted XC consultation.
