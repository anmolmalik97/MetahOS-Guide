**Billing Classes**  
Billing class is used to categorize patients based on their method of payment
or the type of insurance coverage they have. This classification helps in
managing the billing process more efficiently and ensures accurate processing
of payments. Their purpose is to streamline the billing and payment process,
facilitate proper charge capture, and ensure that billing procedures align
with the patientâ€™s financial responsibilities and insurance policies.  
**Billing Class is Used in Hospital Software**

- During the patient registration or admission process, the billing class is assigned based on the information provided by the patient or their guarantor.
- Generates bills or invoices according to the billing class.
- Determines the format and content of the bill, including any necessary breakdowns or explanations.
- Applies appropriate discounts, adjustments, or payment plans based on the billing class.
- For insured patients, the billing class dictates the insurance claim submission process and also ensures that claims are formatted correctly and submitted to the appropriate insurance provider.
