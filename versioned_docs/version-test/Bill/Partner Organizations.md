**Partner Organization**  
Partner organizations refer to external entities that collaborate with the
hospital to provide various services, support, or resources. These
organizations can include insurance companies, other healthcare providers,
suppliers, government agencies, research institutions, and more. The
integration of partner organizations into hospital software enhances
operational efficiency, improves patient care, and facilitates comprehensive
management of hospital activities.
