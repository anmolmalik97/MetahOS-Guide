### Bill Status

**Bill status** refers to the current state of a patient’s hospital bill. It
helps in tracking and managing the financial transactions related to patient
care. The main statuses are:

**Paid** : The bill has been fully settled, meaning all charges for medical
services and treatments have been paid either by the patient, their insurance,
or a combination of both.  
No outstanding balance is due. The hospital’s accounts receivable for this
bill is zero.

**Unpaid** :The bill has not been settled. It may include bills that are
partially paid or not paid at all.  
There is an outstanding balance that the patient or their insurance needs to
settle. Follow-up might be required to ensure payment is made.

**All** : This refers to all bills regardless of their payment status.  
It includes both paid and unpaid bills, providing a comprehensive view of all
billing transactions for a patient.

### Exclude Pharmacy:

This term indicates that charges related to pharmaceutical services
(medications, drugs dispensed, etc.) are not included in the billing or
reporting process.  
When generating a bill or a financial report, any costs associated with the
hospital pharmacy are excluded. This might be used for specific financial
analyses or billing scenarios where only non-pharmacy-related charges are
considered.
