- The default route is the basic set of permissions and access a new role gets when it’s created in this system.
- The default route also defines the landing page a user sees based on their assigned permissions, directing them to the most relevant section of the system when they log in.
- For example, if user want to set a doctor’s landing page, first give them permission to access the relevant module and then enable specific sub-modules they need. This ensures the doctor lands on the appropriate page with the necessary access when they log in.
