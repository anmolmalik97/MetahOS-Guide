**Contact** : Refers to the information used to communicate with a patient or
their representative. This can include phone numbers, email addresses, and
physical addresses.

for identification and record-keeping.

condition or disease. Symptoms are reported by the patient and are a crucial
part of the diagnosis process.

**Created** :This term refers to the date and time when a patient’s record or
a specific entry (such as a medical note or appointment) was created in the
hospital’s system.

**Created by** :This indicates the healthcare professional or administrative
staff member who created the record or entry in the hospital’s system. It
helps in tracking and accountability.

**Referral Doctor Name** :This is the name of the doctor who referred the
patient to another specialist or service. Referrals are common when a
patient’s condition requires expertise that the initial treating doctor does
not have.  
**Referral By Name** : This can sometimes be synonymous with “Referral Doctor
Name.” However, in certain contexts, it might refer to the entity (such as a
clinic, healthcare organization, or another doctor) that made the referral.
