# About Karmika Seva Kendra (KSK)

**Karmika Seva Kendra (KSK)** is a one-stop service platform established under the **Karnataka Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (KBOCWWB)** to make welfare services easily accessible to construction workers and their families.

The initiative is designed to simplify registration, renewal, and benefit application processes for workers, while ensuring transparency, efficiency, and timely service delivery. By bringing all essential services under one roof—both physically at KSK centers and digitally through the website and mobile application—construction workers can now manage their welfare entitlements without middlemen, delays, or confusion.

## Our Mission

To empower construction workers by providing **hassle-free access** to welfare schemes, financial assistance, and social security benefits through a **digitally enabled, worker-friendly system.**

## Key Features of KSK

- **Easy Registration & Renewal** – Workers can register as beneficiaries of KBOCWWB and renew their membership through KSK centers, the website, mobile app, kiosks, or mobile service units.

- **Welfare Scheme Access** – Direct applications for education assistance, healthcare, maternity support, pensions, and other welfare benefits.

- **Digital Worker E-Card** – A unique digital ID card for every registered worker, enabling quick verification and service access.

- **Multi-channel Services** – Access support through dedicated KSK service centers, online platforms, or field units.

- **Transparency & Tracking** – Workers can track application status, payments, and service delivery online in real time.

- **Support & Guidance** – Trained Service Representatives (Karmika Mitras) are available to guide workers through applications, documentation, and issue resolution.

## Why KSK Matters

Construction workers are the backbone of Karnataka's growth and development. However, many face challenges in availing welfare benefits due to lack of awareness, digital literacy, or accessibility issues. **KSK bridges this gap** by ensuring that every worker—whether in rural areas, urban projects, or migrant communities—has equal access to the benefits they deserve.

Through its hybrid model of **technology + human assistance**, KSK ensures that workers are not left behind in the digital era and that their welfare is prioritized with dignity and efficiency.
